    <h4> Visual artist with a career in graphic design, exploring creative coding, and web development</h4>
    <p>As an artist, I am interested  the intersection of creative coding, digital art, and traditional art mediums, weaving these elements together to craft dynamic and innovative works.</p>

    <p>Over the years, I’ve work  in a variety of creative projects, including:<p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Print Design:</strong> Crafting visually compelling book covers and magazine layouts, focusing on storytelling through composition and typography.</li> 
      <li><strong>Brand Identity:</strong> Designing unique logos that reflect a brand's personality and establish cohesive visual identities.</li> 
      <li><strong>Digital Media:</strong> Creating animations and web designs that merge functionality with creativity for engaging user experiences.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the past, I’ve also dabbled other creative paths, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Stage and lighting design</strong>, where I focused on creating props for various productions, as assistant designer. </li>
      <li><strong>Puppetry theatre group</strong> during my student years, bringing stories to life through artistic expression.</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>I’m passionate about discovering ways to merge hands-on artistic practices with technology,  aiming to push the boundaries of what’s possible in both digital and tangible forms of expression.</p>
